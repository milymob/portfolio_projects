DATA ANALYST PORTFOLIO PROJECTS

in this repository, you will find a collection of self-driven data projects i have 
completed using either PostgreSQL or R languages. 

some skills you can expect to see in this repository are:

SQL - joins, CTE's, temp tables, aggregate functions, creating views

R - creating useful data tables with specific parameters for vizs, cleaning + merging datasets, 
  creating insightful vizs within R

i hope to have successfully shown the skills i hold as a Data Analyst.

enjoy :)
